# Leaflet Challenge: Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

*Leaflet Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 15*

## Background
*The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.*

*The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.*
## Assignment Components
This repository consists of two main components:

* **Interactive Page (`index.html`):**
This *HTML* file contains the interactive page with visualizations. It is the vessel for `logic.js`.

* **JavaScript Logic Code (`logic.js`):**
This *JavaScript* file contains the core of the visualizations and data pulls. It utilizes *D3* to pull data from the USGS API and *Leaflet* to create the map and interactive elements.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Interactive page with visualizations; the vessel for `logic.js`.
- `logic.js`: *JavaScript* code containing the core of the visualizations and data pulls (contained in the *static/js* directory).

All code written and edited in *Visual Studio Code*, tested with *Chrome* browser.
We're also in the middle of a project so it may just be thrown together in a hurry. Least it works!

Coding Soundtrack for this week's challenge was Killswitch Engage's album, [Alive or Just Breathing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nD4NmO43H_GdJxciUradf3GuvUY_gpfAA).
